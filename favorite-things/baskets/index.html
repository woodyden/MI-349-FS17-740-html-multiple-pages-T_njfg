    <h1>Alex's Chopped Fansite</h1>
    <p>Every round of chopped, the contestants get a basket of 4 mystery ingredients. Contestants must incorporate all of these ingredients into a dish of their own choosing. This leads contestants to get creative in their presentations and cooking process, as they have no way of planning their meals in advance.</p>
