    <h1>Alex's Chopped Fansite</h1>
    <p> The game's format is unique for most cooking shows. Each episode features a new set of 4 contestants who must cook during an appetizer, entree and dessert round. One contestant is 'chopped' (or eliminated) each round with the final 2 contestants facing off at the end.</p>
